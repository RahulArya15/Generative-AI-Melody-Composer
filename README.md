# Melody-Generator
• Developed a Generative AI melody generator using RNN and LSTM
architectures to create original musical compositions.
• Trained the model on a custom dataset of musical compositions sourced from
http://www.esac-data.org
• Implemented the Generative AI melody generator in Python with TensorFlow,
Keras, and the music21 library for music analysis and composition.
• Utilized MuseScore, a music composition software, to play and evaluate the
melodies generated

The model that I created is saved as model.h5 with is also present in the repository
The other files such as dataset and mapping.json also created while preprocessing the data and training the model.
