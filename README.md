# Melody Maestro: Generative AI Melody Composer

## Overview

Melody Maestro is an innovative project that leverages Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to compose original musical melodies. Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, this project creates unique and captivating musical compositions.

## Features

- **Generative AI Melody Composition:** Melody Maestro employs RNN and LSTM architectures to generate musical compositions. It can produce entirely original melodies that resonate with the user.

- **Custom Dataset:** The model has been trained on a custom dataset of musical compositions sourced from [ESAC (Electronic Sacred Art Database)](http://www.esac-data.org), ensuring a diverse range of musical styles and patterns.

- **Python with TensorFlow and Keras:** The Generative AI melody generator is implemented in Python, with TensorFlow and Keras as the primary libraries. These tools provide robust support for AI-driven musical composition.

- **Music Analysis and Composition:** The project utilizes the music21 library to analyze and compose music. This library enhances the quality and uniqueness of the generated melodies.

- **Melody Evaluation:** To play and evaluate the melodies generated, a widely-used music composition software. This allows users to experience and assess the musical compositions.
